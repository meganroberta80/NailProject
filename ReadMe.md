# SEI Project One: Nail Website
 
## Description 
This application creates a website that allows clients to create accounts and schedule various services at a nail salon. It also saves the client’s appointments within their account.
 
## Technologies Used
* We utilized CSS for the website’s appearance and formatting.
* EJS for website requests. (get, post, etc.)
* JavaScript for controllers and models. 
 
## Challenges Faced
A challenge we faced was managing both the formatting of the website while still adding additional functionality features to it. 
 
## Future Features
* We hope to implement a feature that blocks out time slots if they’ve already been scheduled. 
* We want to allow customers to leave reviews and pictures of their finished services.

## What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? 
This project was assigned to allow us to build a full stack web application using Express, Node, EJS, Mongoose, and MongoDB. It will allow clients to make and change their appointments at a hypothetical nail salon, without having to call or be on hold with the staff. It also allows staff to focus on providing services, rather than taking calls for appointments.
